# BookHaven

A simple React app to browse and manage a list of books using a public API.  
This project is part of my frontend learning where I implemented search, details, favorites, and a clean responsive UI.

## Features

- **Search Books**: Search books by title/author using the API.
- **Responsive Book Grid**: Each book card shows **cover, title, author, publish year**.
